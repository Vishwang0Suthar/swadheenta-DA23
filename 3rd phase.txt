The Naari Station-

This is the final phase submission of the Hack infinity hackathon. 
At first our team was working on the idea base and how will we execute it. In the first phase we submited the 
the base code of our frontend and the database we have used.
now as the second phase ends we linked all the existing website with each other 
and connected our database to the pages.
we faced some problems while connecting the database and the web pages about data retreiving and storing.
Even with the frontend the syncing of css and html together with the source code was challenging.
But till now we have done our best to solve all the problems and we'll continue to do the same.

And for the second phase we made the page For user's to login we added a page where if the user already have an account they can login by email ID and 
password but the password must be of 6 characters or they won't be able to login.
And for the first time user there's an option for sign up under the login page.
By clicking on that the page redirect to the sign up page so that they can create an account for which the web
page is in process of submiting the data.

Now after completing the third stage we now have a prototype  of how in future we want to work on our site 
we connect the firebase database to store the data and retrive it. At the end we were able to create a platfrom 
we hoped for. At end we were able to create the platfrom for women for their rectification.
now we have a working website.

This was a fun hackathon to work on we learned a lot and faced our challenges.
