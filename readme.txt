at first our team was working on the idea base and how will we execute it. In the first phase we submited the 
the base code of our frontend and the database we have used.
now as the second phase ends we linked all the existing website with each other 
and connected our database to the pages.
we faced some problems while connecting the database and the web pages about data retreiving and storing.
Even with the frontend the syncing of css and html together with the source code was challenging.
But till now we have done our best to solve all the problems and we'll continue to do the same.

For the last phase remaining we wanna alter the way we were facing difficulties and we will try to improve 
for sure.

For user's login we added a page where if the user already have an account they can login by email ID and 
password but the password must be of 6 characters or they won't be able to login.
And for the first time user there's an option for sign up under the login page.
By clicking on that the page redirect to the sign up page so that they can create an account for which the web
page is in process of submiting the data.
